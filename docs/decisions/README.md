# Decisions Folder

This folder contains **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** - documents that capture important technical decisions made during development.

## Purpose

Each ADR explains:
- **What** was decided
- **Why** it was decided
- **What changed** as a result

## Background

This folder was created on **2025-12-02** as part of introducing more rigorous coding standards. Prior to this, StatsChat was a prototype/experimental project. As the project matures, we're documenting key technical decisions for future reference and team onboarding.

## File Naming

Files follow the pattern: `NNN-short-description.md`

Example: `001-pymupdf-migration.md`

## Current Records

| ADR | Title | Date |
|-----|-------|------|
| 001 | [PyMuPDF Migration](./001-pymupdf-migration.md) | 2025-12-02 |
